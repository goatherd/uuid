Adjustments
-----------

Optimised for use with PHP 5.3 or newer. Coding conventions now are closer to
PEAR standards.

Single class was refactored using a factory pattern.

Composer support was added and registered with [packagist](https://packagist.org/).

With beta and stable release some improvements and unit tests will be added.
